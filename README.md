##  Overview
This project focuses on creating a clear and practical MI (Management Information) dashboard to support day-to-day operational decision-making.

The main goal was to turn raw operational data into an easy-to-use reporting tool that helps managers understand workload, backlog, SLA performance and potential risk areas.

I designed this dashboard with a strong focus on usability and business value, making sure it can be used by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

##  Dataset
The dataset includes operational and performance-related data such as:

- workload volumes  
- backlog levels  
- SLA compliance  
- time-based performance trends  

It reflects a realistic operational environment where regular reporting is essential for managing performance and resources.
